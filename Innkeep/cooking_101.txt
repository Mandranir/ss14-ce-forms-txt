Greetings to whom this may be reading. I am Keydi Moonlight. This information I have written in here are recipes that I have learned to make over the years while I had worked as an Innkeeper. I hope that the recipes you read here help you out, weather it be cooking at home, or even cooking at your local inn. Whatever the case may be. Enjoy what I had learned and maybe you too can find your own recipes.

                                      [head=2]Simple Cooking[/head]

   While you maybe excited to get into more advanced forms of cooking, it is always best to know the basics. Sometimes, some folks just want a simple meal after all.

                                        [bold]=Cooking meats=[/bold]
   While you may try and eat any meat you find from hunts or travels, uncooked meats are not healthy and can lead to one getting sick. Cooking meats is very simple and can help prevent one from any illnesses. Simply place wood into a stove, then light the wood inside the stove. Once the fire has begun, place the desired meats onto the stove and let it cook. Remember to keep an eye on the food else you run the risk of burning it. Burned food does not taste good nor is it healthy for you. 

                                     [bold]=Herbs and and Fruits=[/bold]
  Through out the world, there is many plants we have discovered. While we have made many discoveries, we had managed to cultivate plants that are edible for consumption. While I can list the many fruits and herbs we have to cultivate, it is best you can discover what there is out there. Many of which are already in use in our everyday lives in farming for us to consume. While we can eat these greens as they are, it is best to cut up them for snacks or even travel. All you need is a sharp tool. You can in turn cut these foods into smaller portions that may fit into bags.

                                                [head=2]Baking[/head]

   Now that we understand the basics of what we can do in simple cooking for simple meals, we may move onto another method of cooking. Baking is one of the many methods we have learned to cook certain foods. From apple pies to simple loafs of bread. Baking has helped make these foods possible. Here are some recipes of some baked goods I have learned to make.

                                                   [bold]=Bread=[/bold]
   Learning to bake, I have learned two types of breads to make, a [italic]Loaf[/italic] and a [italic]Bun[/italic].

To make a Bread [italic]Bun[/italic], you will need to:
• Gather at least 1 bundle of wheat
• Bring it to the Cooking table
• Begin to make a small dough bun from the wheat
• Heat the bun over a stove
• Let the bun cook til it is golden brown
and like that you have yourself a bread bun

To make a Bread [italic]Loaf[/italic], you will need to:
• Create 4 small dough buns
• Merge the 4 smaller dough into one lager one
• Place the large dough on the stove
• let it sit for a few minutes til it is golden brown
and like that you have baked some bread. You may slice the loaf to get slices of bread. Enjoy your bread.

                                                   [bold]=Pies=[/bold]
   Pies are another baking good we had learned to make. Weather pumpkin, apple, or even a meat pie. Pies are one of our beloved baked goods.

To bake a pie, you will need:
• Grab a pie tin
• Grab ingredients of your choice
• Put the ingredients into the pie tin until full
• Place the filled tin onto the stove
• Let it sit till it's golden brown
Now you have yourself a baked pie. You can use this for simply baking any kind of pie you wish. Don't forget to cut the pie and enjoy a slice

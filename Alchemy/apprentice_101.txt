TODO

Ideas:
- Give general goal & reason why every time
    - Keeping the essences stocked
    - Keeping the wood stocked
    - Keeping the barrels stocked (water atleast)
    - Keeping the vials stocked
    - Bring as much plants as possible and favour variety (better to have 10 each than 50 of one and none of the others)
    - Advertise the shop to adventurers in town (go in the tavern, point people to quest board where price_list and buy_list will be also displayed, give shop directions)
    - Aid the alchemist by asking what people need and see if you can accomodate them if demand is high.
- Buying Vials
- Essence collector
- Gathering plants
- Gathering wood
- Tools
- Always consult the alchemist if needed

TODO

Ideas:
- Give general goal & reason why every time
    - Keeping the essences stocked
    - Keeping the wood stocked
    - Keeping the barrels stocked (water atleast)
    - Keeping the vials stocked
    - Bring as much plants as possible and favour variety (better to have 10 each than 50 of one and none of the others)
    - Advertise the shop to adventurers in town (go in the tavern, point people to quest board where price_list and buy_list will be also displayed, give shop directions)
    - Aid the alchemist by asking what people need and see if you can accomodate them if demand is high.
- Buying Vials
- Essence collector
- Gathering plants
- Gathering wood
- Tools
- Always consult the alchemist if needed

[bold][color=#7dad60][head=1][italic]             	Alchemist Apprentice 101[/italic][/head][/color][/bold]

Welcome to the shop, apprentice!

This guide aims to give you directions to help your alchemist in their duties or provide some tips for a beginner alchemist. 
This is not an Alchemist guide, it'll cover some aspects of alchemy but not the entirety of it.

Let's cover the basics.

[head=2]The Alchemist's Role[/head]

[italic]Wise, humble and caring. Each death, a burden weighing on their shoulders.
For their duty, is to keep the mortals standing and the crystal unshattered.[/italic] 

The role of the alchemist is to provide alchemical solutions to the town as well as healing / bringing back
the wounded with their vivification staff.

Alchemical solutions can have multiple uses, inspect your guidebook for a detailed answer but in brief:
[bullet]Utility: [italic]Run faster, slow down or drain off the mana your opennents.[/italic]
[bullet]Healing: [italic]Covers all kinds of remedies to treat all kinds of wounds.[/italic]
[bullet]Harmful: [italic]It could be poison that can be put on arrows or burning potions that can be thrown.[/italic]

Though it is not their main duty, you will see alchemists keep the demiplane crystal filled with mana.

[head=2]The Alchemist's Needs[/head]

[head=3]Essences[/head]

Essences are the main ingredients of solutions.
Alchemists start with 6 vials in their lockers covering the most basic ones (Ordo, Aer, Terra, Victus, Aqua, Perditio).
Eventually the alchemist will run out of them, to avoid that, here are some ways you can replenish them:
[bullet]Use the [bold]Essence Collector[/bold] with a [bold]charged [color=#025b83]energyshard[/color][bold] near an [bold]essence node[/bold].
    [bullet]Here are some node locations:
        [bullet]Above tavern.
        [bullet]Above house n3 (north west of town).
        [bullet]East gate, immediatly north, go inside west mineshaft.
        [bullet]East gate, follow road, at crossroad go north and follow road till the end.
        [bullet]South gate, immediatly east, in the house backyard.
        [bullet]South of town, underground.
[bullet]Use equal amount species blood and blood roses nectar in a mortar, then magic split with a mana glove to make essences.
        [bullet]Add 1u to the mix of essence you want more of, put it all in the solution cleaner, make sure you turn it off when it's cleansed.


[head=3]Ingredients[/head]

Alchemical ingredients or plants (and quartz, though there should be a barrel full of it somewhere in the shop)
can be found around town, use a sharp object to gather them.
Bring these back as these are useful for advanced potion recipes and potion cleansing techniques.

[head=3]Wood[/head]

Wood is used for many things by the alchemist, go outside the town (be wary of monsters lurking around)
and gather some wood using a sickle or dagger if you don't have an axe.

Here's some alchemist's use for wood:
[bullet]Making barrels to hold liquids.
[bullet]Feeding the furnace to heat up solutions.
[bullet]Making a workbench & wood tools with it.

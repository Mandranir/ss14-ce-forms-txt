Ideas:
- Give steps and proper ratios for price_list.txt potions (currently in my head).
- Give general tips on solution cleaning (quartz + favouring alt recipe, Lumishroom)
- Give all alchemical ingredients (plants, rocks, glands...) units when grinded.
    - Ingredients juices unit (when grinded with mortar):
        - Quartz: 7
        - Sage: 15
        - Fly Agaric: 3
        - Blood Rose: 12
        - Blue Amanita: 5
        - Lumishroom: 4
        - Air lily: 4
